The data layout for Pandas DataFrames is **column-major** (read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order)), which means that column-wise operations are always going to be faster than row-wise operations. The second example above uses `axis=1`, making it a row-wise operation, which would be more appropriate for **row-major** data layouts such as NumPy arrays.\n",
